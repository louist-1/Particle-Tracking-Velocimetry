## Particle Tracking Velocimetry
This is the code I wrote for my first year University of Birmingham "Labs and Data analysis" Chemical engineering module's 'Particle Tracking Velocimetry' project. The brief being: to construct a 'home experiment' to measure coefficient of restitution of an object. 
I hope it will be of some assistance to others attempting similar projets.
### What is it?
This code simply tracks a circular object, currently tailored to a table tennis ball, plots the locations of the found circles in every frame and calculated the corresponding coefficient of restitution (COR).
It uses the critically aclaimed cv2 python library. The code has comments explaining almost every step.
### Limitations:
This code is by no means perfect and can most definitely be improved upon, it is one of my first python projects and there is likely many other more advanced projects elsewhere.
