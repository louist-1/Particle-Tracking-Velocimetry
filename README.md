## Particle Tracking Velocimetry
This is the code I wrote for my first year University of Birmingham "Labs and Data analysis" Chemical engineering module's 'Particle Tracking Velocimetry' project. 
#### The brief: 
To construct a 'home experiment' to measure coefficient of restitution of an object using particle tracking velocimetry.

### What is it?
This code simply tracks a circular object, currently tailored to a table tennis ball, plots the locations of the found circle (representing the ball) in every frame, and calculates the corresponding coefficient of restitution (COR).
It uses the critically aclaimed cv2 python library to track the ball. See OpenCV.org

The code has comments explaining almost every step/ line of code.
### Limitations:
This code is by no means perfect and can most definitely be improved upon, it is one of my first python projects and there is likely many other more advanced projects elsewhere.

Note it is necessary to press 'q' before the end of the video(s) to prevent an error.
